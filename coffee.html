		<p style="text-align: left;">Due to overwhelming scientific evidence, coffee has earned a new and improved reputation. The latest U.S. Dietary Guidelines recently made an unprecedented recommendation for coffee as part of a healthy lifestyle. 
			Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels.
That’s because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world.After you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to your brain
In the brain, caffeine blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine.
When this happens, the amount of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine increases, leading to enhanced firing of neurons. </p></div>
