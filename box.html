    <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers.  Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>

    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning.</p>
