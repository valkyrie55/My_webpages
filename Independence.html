	<h1>What Independence Day means to the soldiers and their families</h1>
	<h2>
		You know what most army kids remember about Independence Day? That the soldier in their family i.e father or mother- was never really around.</h2>
		 <p>For families of soldiers, Independence Day is a day espousing patriotism and duty. But the day is also an emotional reminder of the sacrifices which come along with it. When the entire country is home celebrating Independence with family, shielded from external threats, the soldier is away from family, defending the country at its frontiers.</p>
    <p>"I remember my father being away most of the time, either for some training exercise or being posted in the forward areas," I remember that we would get together and listen to the PM's speech on TV, and attend the events organised. But what I do remember was that my father was away most of the time."
      They cannot live in the same city for more than a couple of years, or have friends who are 'forever'. They cannot have the 'typical' family life. But families of the Indian Armed Forces deal with it by holding on to each other and living with it. </p>
      <p> Do only a soldier's family is expected to give all the sacrifices?.If it wouldn't be declared National Holiday on 15th of august and 26th January ,people would have forgetten that these days exist.Just  give it a thought.
      Why it happens that on normal days we spend our whole day uploading our pictures,videos etc, and  eventually on Independence  Day ,the social media is full of Patriotic pictures .If you are patriotic by heart,instead of lookng at the sports corner in the news paper every morning ,just go through the page illustrating about the soldiers dying in surgical strikes,think about their families.

    <p>On Independence Day, what is being is celebrated is exactly what an army kid misses - freedom, the freedom to be with their parent and not be bothered about anything else. </p>
    <p>If you want to make  worth of it ,stop posting merely the pictures and keep the feeling of patriotism alive in your heart and live it everyday</p>
